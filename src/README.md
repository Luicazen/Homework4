This library contains a file named heapq.py. This file contains the code necessary to run Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm helps to find the shortest distance between two points on a grid. The file sp.py finishes the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and returns the distance and path taken between the source node and its destination. The library is set up with two folders src, (and the nested) graphs_Luicazen. The inner folder, graphs_Luicazen holds a python init file, heapq.py, and sp.py. While the src folder holds the previously mentioned folder, pyproject.toml, this README.md, and a test.py file for instructor use.
The point of this assignment was to successfully create a github repository and demonstrate the usage of git add/commit to update repository branches. This repository found at: https://github.com/Luicazen/Homework4 has 2 branches, main, & dev. The dev branch is unprotected.
